The system architecture components for the mobile application backend, designed to measure user health, are as follows:

- **Load Balancer**: A load balancer distributes incoming traffic to the backend services for scaling and high availability.

- **Kubernetes Cluster**: The Kubernetes cluster provides an orchestration platform for managing containerized backend services. It allows scaling, load balancing, and resilience.

- **Backend Services**: Java-based backend services implement the business logic for health measurements and expose REST APIs for mobile app interactions. These services handle data processing, analysis, and storage.

- **Database and Cache**: CloudSQL PostgreSQL is used as the primary database for storing health-related data, while Redis serves as an in-memory cache for quick data access. This combination provides data persistence and caching capabilities.

- **Monitoring and Analytics**: Google Cloud Monitoring enables real-time monitoring of the backend services, health metrics, and application performance. BigQuery can be utilized for data analysis, generating insights, and running queries against health-related data.

## Using Terraform

To achieve this architecture using Terraform, you can define the necessary resources and configurations in Terraform code. Here's a high-level overview of the Terraform setup:

1. **Define GCP Provider**: Configure the GCP provider in Terraform, including authentication and project details.

2. **Provision Networking Resources**: Use Terraform to create the required VPC networks, subnets, firewall rules, and load balancers.

3. **Deploy Kubernetes Cluster**: Utilize the Terraform Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) provider to provision the Kubernetes cluster on GCP. Define settings like node pools, autoscaling, and instance configurations.

4. **Containerize and Deploy Backend Services**: Containerize the Java services using Docker. Define Kubernetes deployment and service configurations in Terraform to deploy the backend services onto the Kubernetes cluster.

5. **Provision Database and Cache**: Use Terraform to provision a CloudSQL PostgreSQL instance for the primary database. Additionally, deploy a Redis instance using Terraform for in-memory caching.

6. **Set Up Monitoring and Analytics**: Configure Google Cloud Monitoring for monitoring the backend services and health metrics. Utilize BigQuery for data analysis and generating insights from health-related data.

By defining these resources and configurations in Terraform, you can apply the Terraform code to provision and manage the scalable backend infrastructure on GCP.

Please note that the above architecture and Terraform steps provide a high-level overview. Detailed implementation and customization will depend on your specific requirements and the technologies you choose to use.
